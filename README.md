# Accessible to all

## Description
This website was improved to add accessibilty elements to the design of this Horiseon webpage. I worked on this website because I wanted to learn more about how to make a website more accessible for all. Through research, I learned that sematic elements are used to provide an easier viewing experience for not only users with disabilities, and anyone else who wants a more accessibility-friendly website. I learned which sematic elements were best to use to restructure the code in this project. Refactoring this website taught me to be more aware of accessibilty standards, and I will be sure to pay more attention to this when designing future websites.

## Installation
1. Click on green code button and copy the ssh link
2. Open up terminal or git bash, then navigate to where you want the repository to be placed.
3. Type out "git clone (ssh link)"

## Usage
This project can be used as an example for sematic elements and how to structure them. For example, the 'section' tag in html can be used in place of the non-semantic html tag 'div'. 'section' is a better. 

The tags 'header', 'footer', 'aside', and 'nav' can also be used in the place of 'div' tags.

In the example above, both 'header' and 'nav' are used in place of div tags to make the code more understandable. This also makes the webpage more accessible. 

You can use examples like this to help you add more semantic elements into your code. Other resources used that can help are provided in the credit section.
